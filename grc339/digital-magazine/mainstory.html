            <h2>The Soul Surfer's Road Trip:<br>From Baja to Big Sur</h2>
            <!-- Include filler texts, images, and captions as indicated in the content file. -->
            <p>When you meet Kassia Meador, her calm presence is like a still morning tide—peaceful, reflective, but full of momentum just below the surface. A former professional longboarder turned wetsuit designer, Kassia has spent most of her life chasing the perfect ride, but not necessarily in search of the biggest wave. Her passion lies in the rhythm, the style, and the sacred connection to the ocean that comes from simply showing up—board in hand, soul wide open.</p>
            <figure>
               <img src="serenity.jpeg" alt="Surfer in a wetsuit sitting on a board in calm ocean water, facing a pastel-colored sky during dawn or dusk, creating a peaceful and contemplative scene." />
               <figcaption>A lone surfer waits in the lineup under a pastel sky, embracing the calm between sets.</figcaption>
            </figure>
               <p>Earlier this year, Kassia hit the road with two friends, a film camera, and a 1972 Westfalia van they dubbed Moondust. Their route: a two-week journey from the Baja Peninsula through San Diego, Malibu, Big Sur, and up toward Santa Cruz. “It wasn't about scoring epic conditions,” she says. “It was about letting the surf shape our schedule instead of the other way around.”</p>
               <p>The group camped at secret spots, ate avocado toast cooked over Jetboils, and practiced breathwork on the cliffs at sunrise. Some mornings, they surfed in solitude; other days, they connected with tight-knit local lineups who welcomed them with shared waves and fish tacos. “It reminded me that surfing is about presence,” Kassia reflects. “The best moments weren't even on the waves—it was the laughter after wipeouts, the sound of the stove boiling water while someone waxed their board.”</p>

            </figure>
               <p>Along the way, they documented the beauty of slowness in a sport often obsessed with performance. With film rolls of blurry beaches, journal sketches, and audio clips of crashing waves, the trip was a tribute to a different kind of surf story—the one where community, freedom, and joy are the true destinations.</p>
               <p>“Surfing is not an escape. It's a return—to self, to simplicity, to flow,” Kassia writes in her travel notebook. “The road, like the ocean, always brings you home.”</p>
